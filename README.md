Xilinx ISE project for Spartan 3E Starter Kit board.

This is a first project that consists in an implementation of a Microblaze processor to run an ANN-based Heartbeat Sorter as Standalone,
without any hardware acceleration.

This project was discontinued because the Spartan board isn't powerful enough to run this algorith in real time.

ANN_project continues this development.
